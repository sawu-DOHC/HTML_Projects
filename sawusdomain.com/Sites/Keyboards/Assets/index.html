            <h2>Winter Ebony</h2>
            <p>
                Heavy tactile switch.<br>
                Feel the crisp snap of winter beneath your fingertips with the Winter Ebony experience. 
                Each keystroke begins with a decisive, early tactile peak—like breaking gently through fresh, untouched snow. 
                Complemented by icy-blue keycaps adorned with glacial white letters and an exquisite ebony wood spacebar, every keypress resonates with a crisp, undampened bottom-out, evoking the harsh, unforgiving chill of deep winter.

                Light linear switch.<br>
                Feel the gentle bloom of spring beneath your fingertips with the Spring Rose experience.
                Each keystroke is smooth and steady—like nature awakening after winter’s pause, bringing the quiet promise of renewal and hope.
                Softened by switch dampers, every keypress feels honey-smooth and controlled. Pastel keycaps paired with a warm rosewood spacebar evoke the calm ease of springtime growth.

            <p>
                Light tactile switch.<br>
                Feel the relaxed ease of summer beneath your fingertips with the Summer Ivory experience.
                Each keystroke is light and effortless, marked by a subtle tactile bump—a developed refinement from spring’s undeveloped linear strokes, crafted to reduce effort during hot, lazy days.
                Enhanced by subtle switch dampers and complemented by crisp white keycaps paired with a soft, lightly-colored wooden spacebar, typing becomes a cool, comfortable breeze amid summer’s warmth.

                Clicky Tactile switch.<br>
                Feel the crisp crunch of autumn beneath your fingertips with the Fall Walnut experience.
                Each keystroke delivers a distinct, audible click—a sharper, more defined tactile sensation compared to summer's soft and subtle bump, signaling the shift to tougher, colder times ahead.
                Enhanced with switch dampers for comfortable typing, and adorned with earthy-toned keycaps complemented by a rich walnut wood spacebar, typing feels cozy yet decisive, perfectly capturing the bittersweet spirit of fall.
