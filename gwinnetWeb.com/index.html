    <p>
      Hi, I’m Sam — a local web developer based in Gwinnett County, GA. I specialize in building clean, efficient websites coded by hand from the ground up.
      If you're looking for a site that’s fast, easy to maintain, and built to fit your exact needs,
      <a href="mailto:hello@gwinnettweb.dev">feel free to reach out</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Unlike drag-and-drop site builders that can generate tens of thousands of lines of bloated code, my work is streamlined and purposeful.
      Every line serves a function. The result? A site that’s faster, more flexible, and far easier to manage or expand in the future.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I offer clear documentation with every project, so whether you're maintaining the site yourself or handing it off to another developer, you're never locked in.
      You'll have full ownership of your site — no subscriptions, no proprietary platforms, no surprises.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Discounts are available for veterans and first responders — just ask.
      I take pride in offering a straightforward service with working-class values: honest work, fair pricing, and results you can count on.
    </p>
